Aqua is a collection of useful libraries for Luau development 
</div>

## Overview
Aqua is a collection of open source libraries we created that assist in developing games on the ROBLOX platform.

They are updated regularly as our needs are ever evolving, though there
is no garuntee that a library will keep getting updated forever.

## Usage
We use [wally](https://wally.run) for package management. Ensure you have the following installed
on your system if you wish to develop with Aqua:
- Aftman
- Rojo
- Wally

Once you install and configure the above, add the following to your `wally.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
Aqua = "aquiline-rblx/aqua@0.1.0"
```

You will then be able to use all the libraries Aqua provides. Happy scripting!

## Acknowledgements
Aqua would not be possible without these amazing open source tools and their
helpful communities:
- [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) - Aftman is a really neat tool that allows us to  install things like Wally to better manage our packages.
- [Wally](https://wally.run) - Wally is a package manager similar to LuaRocks, but
  for the Roblox platform.
- [Rojo](https://rojo.space) - Rojo is a set of professional grade development
  tools for Roblox.
